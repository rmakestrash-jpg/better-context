## Effect Solutions Usage

The Effect Solutions CLI provides curated best practices and patterns for Effect TypeScript. Before working on Effect code, check if there's a relevant topic that covers your use case.

- `effect-solutions list` - List all available topics
- `effect-solutions show <slug...>` - Read one or more topics
- `effect-solutions search <term>` - Search topics by keyword

**Local Effect Source:** The Effect repository is cloned to `~/.local/share/effect-solutions/effect` for reference. Use this to explore APIs, find usage examples, and understand implementation details when the documentation isn't enough.

## Code Style

- **Runtime**: Bun only. No Node.js, npm, pnpm, vite, dotenv.
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled. ESNext target.
- **Effect**: Use `Effect.gen` for async code, `BunRuntime.runMain` for entry points.
- **Imports**: External packages first, then local. Use `.ts` extensions for local imports.
- **Bun APIs**: Prefer `Bun.file`, `Bun.serve`, `bun:sqlite`, `Bun.$` over Node equivalents.
- **Testing**: Use `bun:test` with `import { test, expect } from "bun:test"`.

## Scripts

- run `bun check` to check for errors

## Error Handling

- Use Effect's error channel for typed errors.
- Use `Effect.tryPromise` for async operations, `Effect.try` for sync.
- Pipe errors through Effect combinators, don't throw.
