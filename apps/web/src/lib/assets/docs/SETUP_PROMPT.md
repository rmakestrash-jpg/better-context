# btca Setup Prompt

## Quick Copy-Paste Version

```
Set up btca for this project: scan package.json for major dependencies (frameworks, libraries, tools), then show me the full list of resources you'd suggest. Once I confirm the list, prepare the btca.config.jsonc with all resources and show it to me for approval before creating files. Work in batches, not one-by-one.
```

## Detailed Instructions

If your agent needs more context, use this expanded version:

Set up btca (Better Context) for this project by following these steps:

## Step 1: Scan Dependencies

Check package.json (or equivalent package manager files) and identify libraries/frameworks that would benefit from btca integration. Look for:

- **Frameworks**: Svelte, React, Vue, Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Remix, Astro
- **Backend**: Effect, Hono, Express, Fastify, tRPC
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, UnoCSS
- **Tooling**: TypeScript, Vite, esbuild, Bun
- **Syntax**: Shiki, Prism
- **Other major libraries**: Drizzle, Prisma, Zod, etc.

## Step 2: Present Full Resource List

After scanning, show me the **complete list** of suggested resources in a simple format:

```
Found these dependencies that would benefit from btca:

1. svelte - Svelte framework docs and source
2. tailwind - Tailwind CSS documentation
3. effect - Effect-TS library docs
4. drizzleOrm - Drizzle ORM documentation
... etc

Note: Resource names should be camelCase (e.g., drizzleOrm, not drizzle-orm).

Does this list look good, or would you like to add/remove any?
```

**Wait for my confirmation before proceeding.** I might say:

- "Looks good" - proceed with all
- "Remove X and Y" - exclude those
- "Add Z" - include additional ones

## Step 3: Show Prepared Config

Once I approve the resource list, prepare the full `btca.config.jsonc` with sensible defaults and **show it to me before writing any files**:

```jsonc
{
	"$schema": "https://btca.dev/btca.schema.json",
	"resources": [
		{
			"name": "svelte",
			"type": "git",
			"url": "https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte.dev",
			"branch": "main",
			"searchPath": "apps/svelte.dev",
			"specialNotes": "Svelte docs website. Focus on content directory for markdown docs."
		},
		{
			"name": "tailwind",
			"type": "git",
			"url": "https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com",
			"branch": "main",
			"searchPath": "src/docs"
		}
		// ... all approved resources
	],
	"model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
	"provider": "opencode"
}
```

Ask: "Here's the config I'll create. Want me to change anything before I write it?"

**Wait for approval** before creating files. I might want to:

- Change a repo URL
- Adjust a searchPath
- Add specialNotes
- Change branch names

## Step 4: Create Files

Only after I approve the config:

1. Create `btca.config.jsonc` in the project root
2. Add `.btca` to `.gitignore` (create the file if it doesn't exist, or append if it does)

## Step 5: Ask About Usage Mode

Ask me which mode I want the agent to use btca in:

```
How would you like your AI agent to use btca?

1. **eager** - Agent uses btca automatically whenever it thinks it needs up-to-date info
2. **ask** - Agent asks you first before using btca to research
3. **lazy** - Agent only uses btca when you explicitly say "use btca" in your prompt

Which mode? (eager/ask/lazy)
```

**Wait for my response** before updating AGENTS.md.

## Step 6: Update AGENTS.md

Check if an `AGENTS.md` file exists in the project root:

- **If it exists**: Look for an existing `## btca` section and update it
- **If it doesn't exist**: Create `AGENTS.md` with the btca section

Add or update this section based on the chosen mode:

**For "eager" mode:**

```markdown
## btca

When you need up-to-date information about technologies used in this project, use btca to query source repositories directly.

**Available resources**: [comma-separated list of all resource names from config]

### Usage

\`\`\`bash
btca ask -r <resource> -q "<question>"
\`\`\`

Use multiple `-r` flags to query multiple resources at once:

\`\`\`bash
btca ask -r svelte -r effect -q "How do I integrate Effect with Svelte?"
\`\`\`
```

**For "ask" mode:**

```markdown
## btca

When you need up-to-date information about technologies used in this project, ask the user if they'd like you to use btca to research.

**Available resources**: [comma-separated list of all resource names from config]

### Usage

\`\`\`bash
btca ask -r <resource> -q "<question>"
\`\`\`

Use multiple `-r` flags to query multiple resources at once:

\`\`\`bash
btca ask -r svelte -r effect -q "How do I integrate Effect with Svelte?"
\`\`\`
```

**For "lazy" mode:**

```markdown
## btca

When the user says "use btca" for codebase/docs questions.

**Available resources**: [comma-separated list of all resource names from config]

### Usage

\`\`\`bash
btca ask -r <resource> -q "<question>"
\`\`\`

Use multiple `-r` flags to query multiple resources at once.
```

## Step 7: Provide Summary

After completing the setup, show me:

1. **Configured resources** (list with name, type, and URL/path)
2. **Config file location** (absolute path)
3. **AGENTS.md status** (created or updated, with which mode)
4. **Example commands** specific to my project's resources
5. **Next steps**:
   - "Resources will be cloned to `~/.local/share/btca/resources/` on first use"
   - "Use `btca clear` to remove cached git repositories if needed"

## Instructions for Agent

**Behavior Guidelines**:

- **Work in batches, not one-by-one** - show the full list of resources at once
- Present the complete list first, get confirmation, then show the prepared config
- Only 2 confirmation points: (1) the resource list, (2) the prepared config
- Show me what you're about to write before writing it
- Don't add resources I haven't explicitly approved
- If `AGENTS.md` exists with a btca section, update it cleanly without duplication

**Technical Requirements**:

- Config file: `btca.config.jsonc` in project root
- Format: Valid JSON with comments (JSONC)
- Schema: Include the `$schema` field for validation
- Resources: Only include those I've approved
- Resource names: Use camelCase, not hyphen-case (e.g., `drizzleOrm` not `drizzle-orm`)
- Model defaults: `"claude-haiku-4-5"` with provider `"opencode"`

**Common Resource Patterns**:

| Library  | Suggested URL                           | Branch | Search Path     | Notes        |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------- | ------------ |
| Svelte   | github.com/sveltejs/svelte.dev          | main   | apps/svelte.dev | Docs website |
| Effect   | github.com/Effect-TS/effect             | main   | -               | Main repo    |
| Tailwind | github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com | main   | src/docs        | Docs website |
| Next.js  | github.com/vercel/next.js               | canary | docs            | Next.js docs |
| Hono     | github.com/honojs/hono                  | main   | -               | Main repo    |

Use these as starting points, but always confirm with me first.
